# Python Data Science - Session 2

This repository contains exercises for Python Data Science Session 2. Each exercise is implemented in its own branch for better organization and version control.

Exercises
- Exercise 1: FizzBuzz - A simple program to print "Fizz" for multiples of 3, "Buzz" for multiples of 5, and "FizzBuzz" for multiples of both.
- Exercise 2: Basic Data Filtering - A function to filter out only integers from a list containing mixed data types.
- Exercise 3: Simple To-Do List - A basic to-do list manager with functions to add and display tasks.
- Exercise 4: Temperature Converter - A function to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.
